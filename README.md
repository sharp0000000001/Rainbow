# Rainbow
Cube that changes to every color...

Install in a C++ Visual Studio 22 console C++ project.
Adjust the directory includes to account for where the GLFW and GLEW are.
Adjust for where GRAPHICS.H is.
Add to the project: GLEW.LIB, GLFW.lib and OPENGL32.lib.

In addition add GLEW and GLFW with Opengl32 to the C:\windows\system32 directory.

Thank you
